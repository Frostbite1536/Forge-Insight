# Forge Insight

## Overview

Forge Insight is a user-friendly desktop application designed for querying, visualizing, and exporting data from blockchain subgraphs, specifically tailored for the **Forge** decentralized exchange (DEX) on the **Evmos** network. This powerful tool provides users with the insights needed to analyze DEX activities, understand token metrics, and monitor user behaviors efficiently.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Subgraph Support**: Query data from multiple subgraphs on the Evmos network.
- **Data Visualization**: Create various chart types to visualize query results, including bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, and pie charts.
- **Data Export**: Export your results in multiple formats such as CSV, JSON, Excel, or directly to Google Sheets.
- **Custom Queries**: Build and customize your GraphQL queries with filters and sorting options.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: An intuitive interface designed for both novice and experienced users.
- **Plugin Management**: Extend the application's capabilities through a flexible plugin system.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging to aid in debugging and user support.
